### Name:Sanjay Ashwin P
### Reg no:212223040181
## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Experiment: Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).
Generative AI applications.
Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm:
1.Set up tools : Choose any one LLM interface

2.Design the prompts : Prepare 4 prompts that progressively apply prompt-engineering techniques:

3.Run the prompts on the same task.

4.Record outputs and write the report.
## Prompt
Create a Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models for 8 to 10 pages if require add images also in it and give me as a word file.
## Output

[Sanjay Ashwin comprehensive report prompt.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22093476/Sanjay.Ashwin.comprehensive.report.prompt.pdf)

## Result
The experiment showed that prompt design greatly improves the quality of outputs from LLMs. It successfully demonstrated Generative AI concepts, architectures, applications, and scaling impacts.
